**My attempt at a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the console.

For those unaware of the game:
- There are two players
- Both will choose one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors) and display their choice simultaneously
- rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper
- If both players choose the same option, it is a draw

At this stage, it is only meant to be played using the **browser's console**. 

Next thing to do is:
1. fix win, loose, tie results so that each round distributes victory counter appropriately.
2. allow player input (case in-sensitive)
3. consider using more helper functions
